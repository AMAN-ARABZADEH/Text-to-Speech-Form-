# Text-to-Speech-Form-
In this program, the user can enter the text in multiply choice, to listen to the text. 
It is simple, and you can use it to listen to the PDF you don't want to read,
however, I should mention that the API I use are from other sources, be careful what you input the textarea.
Do not! I say, DO NOT put your password, email, important text in this program. Because the API is from an external provider.
This is just for the use of small, not important text,  you want to listen to instead, such as Wikipedia texts, PDF from internet, 
not important things, only text that could be found in public access. These are things I recommend using this program for.
