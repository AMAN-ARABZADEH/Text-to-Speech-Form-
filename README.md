# Text-to-Speech-Form-
In this program, the user can enter the text in multy chice, the listen to the text. 
It is simple andd you can use it to listen to the PDF you don't want to read,
however I should mention that the API I use are from other sources, be careful what you input the textarea.
Do not! I say, DO NOT put your password, email, important text in this program. Because the API is from external provider.
This is just for the use of samll, not important text, you want to listen to instead, such as wikipidia texts, pdf from internet, 
not important things, that could be find in public acess. These are things I recomend to use this program for.
