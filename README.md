# Text-to-Speech-Form-
The Text-to-Speech Form is a program that allows the user to input text in a text area and listen to the text in multiple languages using text-to-speech technology. The program is simple and can be used to listen to text from sources such as Wikipedia and PDFs from the internet, as long as the text is not confidential or sensitive. It is important to note that the program utilizes APIs from external sources, so users should exercise caution when inputting text into the text area. The program is not suitable for entering passwords, email addresses, or other sensitive information. This program is intended for listening to non-confidential, publicly available text only.
